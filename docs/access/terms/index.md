## Security

Secure and effective utilization of MetaCentrum resources is possible only if there will be some operational rules fulfilled. Study therefore really carefully the security rules for work in MetaCentrum and in the network generally.

1. Users has to protect their account by a **non-trivial Kerberos password**. The password must not be shared. The password must not be used in open (non-encrypted) protocols as is e.g. standard unic (non-Kerberized) telnet or ftp.
   
2. Non-trival password is such that can not be deduced (even after simple mutations) from the data known about account owner and that is not a name of a person, animal or object (even after simple mutations). The administrators are authorized to perform tests to look for non-trivial passwords; in the case of positive results will inform the account owner by secure way. Followingly the account owner have to change the password immediately (the original account can be locked until the time of password change).

3. Users are not allowed to share their accounts. If it is necessary to share the account due to some reasons (e.g. software installation), it has to be done using Kerberos (i.e. through ".k5login" file) and it should be also discussed with specific administrators.

4. If the password is compromised, it is necessary to change it as soon as possible - see [How to change your password](../../access/account/#password-change)     .

5. Usage of non-secured protocols telnet, ftp etc. at other machines is not recommended as well. If this authentication method is used, one has to take into account lower security level of specific accout (and disclosure of the password in open form transferred by the network). It is forbidden use such account to log in to MetaCentrum through Kerberos or SSH protocol due to danger of security breach using weakly secured account followed by usage of fake ssh or fake Kerberos with a trojan horse and consequently danger of breach of MetaCentrum accounts.

6. Strange behaviour of your account, appearance or disapparance of files, unknown processes running under your identity and so on has to be necessarily reported to the administrators of MetaCentrum.

7. Users are solely responsible for setting the required access rules to control the access to their data. N.B., users' home directories are by default readable to all Metacentrum users. If you want to ensure other users cannot enter your home directory, you must change its access rights.
